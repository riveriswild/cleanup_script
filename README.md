## cleanup_script
a simple bash script to clean up any folder
##
For now the script and cleanup.csv should both be placed into the folder you want to clean up.
##
The script sorts files by categories (see "cleanup.csv" for relation between file formsts and folders) and places them into respective folders. If the folders do not exist, creates them.
## Launch
```
bash cleanupscrpt.sh
```
